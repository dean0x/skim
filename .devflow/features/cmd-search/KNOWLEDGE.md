# Search CLI (skim search subcommand)

## Overview

`crates/rskim/src/cmd/search/` is the CLI orchestration layer for `skim search`. It is the only code that performs I/O, parses flags, coordinates the build pipeline, triggers auto-refresh, resolves paths, and formats output. All business logic — n-gram extraction, BM25F scoring, AST index construction, temporal risk scoring, co-change matrices — lives in the `rskim-search` library crate. This layer exists solely to wire those library features together into a cohesive user-facing command.

The module is split into ten focused files: `mod.rs` (dispatch + hand-rolled flag parsing), `index.rs` (streaming pipeline), `query.rs` (search execution + formatters), `staleness.rs` (git-HEAD-based auto-refresh + AST self-heal), `types.rs` (pure data types), `ast.rs` (AST flag helpers), `temporal.rs` (temporal flag helpers), `manifest.rs` (JSONL sidecar), `walk.rs` (file traversal), and `snippet.rs` (context window extraction). The design rule is that I/O lives in `mod.rs`/`index.rs`/`query.rs` and helpers are pulled into the focused sub-modules — never scattered across files.

## System Context

`skim search` is invoked as a subcommand of the main `skim` binary. Its public entry point is `pub(crate) fn run(args: &[String], analytics: &AnalyticsConfig) -> anyhow::Result<ExitCode>` in `mod.rs`. The skim binary passes the slice of arguments that follow `search`.

Cache layout: `~/.cache/skim/search/{sha256(canonical_root)[..16]}/` (per-project hash). Override via `SKIM_CACHE_DIR`. Key files inside:

- `index.skidx` / `index.skfiles` — lexical n-gram index (built by `NgramIndexBuilder`)
- `ast_index.skidx` / `ast_index.skpost` — AST structural index (built by `AstIndexBuilder`)
- `index.skfiles` / `manifest.json` — actually `index.skfiles` is a JSONL sidecar (`FileManifest`)
- `temporal.db` — SQLite temporal DB populated by `skim heatmap`
- `.skim-build.lock` — advisory `flock`-based lock for concurrent build safety

## Component Architecture

### Flag Parsing — hand-rolled, not clap

`mod.rs` uses a manual `parse_flags()` loop rather than clap for the top-level `skim search` flags. This is intentional: `skim search index` (legacy subcommand) does use clap via `IndexCli`, but all other flags are hand-rolled so that positional query arguments are naturally accumulated into `query_parts`.

`SearchAction` enum encodes the mutually exclusive modes (`Build`, `Rebuild`, `Update`, `Stats`, `InstallHooks`, `RemoveHooks`, `Query(String)`). The final `match flags.action` is the single dispatch point — adding a new mode means adding a variant and one match arm.

Flags that require a following token (`--limit N`, `--root PATH`, `--ast PATTERN`, `--blast-radius FILE`) support both space-separated and equals form (`--limit=10`). The helper `take_flag_value(arg, next_arg, flag_name)` handles both forms without a deref coercion — returns `(value, consumed_next)`. The parser advances `i` by one extra when `consumed_next` is `true`.

### Dispatch Ordering — validation before dispatch

`run()` performs all validation in a fixed order before any dispatch:

1. `"index"` prefix → immediately delegate to `index::run()` (legacy subcommand path)
2. Empty args or `--help/-h` → print help (checked BEFORE `parse_flags` to avoid spurious errors)
3. `--ast` + temporal sort (`--hot/--cold/--risky`) → `#202` error (not yet composable)
4. `--ast` single-node pattern → `#283` error
5. Unknown `--ast` pattern → library error (lists valid names)

This ordering is tested and must not be changed without updating tests.

### Streaming Build Pipeline — `index.rs`

`build_index(config)` acquires `.skim-build.lock` (exclusive `flock`) then delegates to `Pipeline::run()`. The pipeline has three stages:

1. **Walk** (`walk_metadata`) — metadata-only directory traversal; returns `Vec<WalkEntry>` sorted for determinism.
2. **Producer thread** — reads content, computes SHA-256, applies 2-tier SHA cache, classifies fields; sends `ProcessedFile` on a `crossbeam_channel::bounded(CHANNEL_CAPACITY=64)` channel.
3. **Consumer loop** (`Pipeline::consume`) — receives files, adds to both lexical and AST builders, inserts manifest entries, drops content immediately.

**Commit ordering** (crash-safety invariant):
```
(1) builder.build()       → writes index.skidx + index.skfiles
(2) ast_builder.build()   → writes ast_index.skpost then ast_index.skidx
(3) new_manifest.save()   → records git HEAD (the commit point)
```
If AST build fails, `manifest.save()` is NEVER reached. The old manifest survives and the next query self-heals. "HEAD recorded ⟹ both indexes coherent" is the invariant.

**FileId-alignment invariant** (critical): the lexical builder and AST builder must receive exactly the same set of files in the same order. `next_file_id` only advances after a successful `add_file_classified`. A lexical builder error causes `continue` — the file is excluded from BOTH indexes. AST entries are always inserted (empty set on linearization error) so FileIds stay aligned. If `add_file_ngrams` fails after `add_file_classified` succeeded, the build aborts with an error and `manifest.save()` is skipped — preventing a committed-but-corrupt index (ADR-006).

**`derive_ast_entry` helper** (index.rs private function): encapsulates per-file AST linearization and extraction. Returns `(AstNgramSet, StructuralMetrics, node_count)`. Deliberately infallible — on any error (grammar failure, linearization error, empty language) returns an empty-but-valid triple so the consume loop can always insert an aligned empty AST entry. The fail-loud path lives in `consume` after `add_file_ngrams` rejects a post-lexical-success entry.

**Producer join on abort**: the producer thread is joined before `consume` returns an error, preventing detached background threads from holding index files open or corrupting the state observed by the next rebuild.

### Staleness and Auto-Refresh — `staleness.rs`

`check_staleness(cache_dir, project_root)` compares the git HEAD stored in the manifest against the current HEAD read from `.git/HEAD` (no git subprocess — pure file I/O). Handles ordinary repos, worktrees (`.git` file with `gitdir:` pointer), detached HEADs, and packed-refs.

`StalenessCheck` outcomes:
- `Current` — no action needed
- `HeadChanged` — rebuild triggered
- `NoStoredHead` — rebuild triggered (old manifest or new git repo)
- `NoIndex` — cold build triggered

**AST self-heal**: `check_staleness` runs an additional check before comparing HEADs. If `ast_index.skidx` is absent OR its format version (6-byte probe via `AstIndexReader::index_version`) is below `AST_INDEX_FORMAT_VERSION`, it returns `NoStoredHead` to force a full rebuild. This handles: post-format-upgrade (v1→v2), crash between `lexical.build()` and `ast.build()`, and first run after adding `--ast` to an existing install.

**Combined text+`--ast` path also self-heals**: `run_query` (in `mod.rs`) calls `auto_refresh_if_stale` before opening the AST engine. This mirrors the standalone `run_ast_standalone` path. Previously a bug existed where `open_ast_engine` was called before `auto_refresh_if_stale`, causing a loud error when the AST index was absent. The fix: always refresh before opening any index.

`auto_refresh_if_stale(root, cache_dir, analytics)` is called at the start of every query path. It returns `(refreshed: bool, manifest: FileManifest)` so the caller never loads the manifest a second time.

### Query Execution — `query.rs`

`execute_query(config, analytics)` is the main query path. Steps:

1. Empty text → short-circuit immediately (no I/O).
2. `auto_refresh_if_stale` — ensures fresh index, returns manifest.
3. Open `NgramIndexReader` → wrap in `QueryEngine`.
4. Build `SearchQuery`: set `limit` and `file_filter`.
5. **File filter construction** — intersection of blast-radius FileIds ∩ AST FileIds. Applied before `LIMIT` so the limit applies to the filtered set. Uses `u32::try_from(idx)` (applies PF-004: safe widening, never `as u32`).
6. `engine.search(&sq)` → raw `Vec<SearchResult>` with FileIds.
7. `resolve_paths_and_snippets` — maps FileId → path via `manifest.sorted_paths()`, extracts snippets.
8. Return `QueryOutput`.

After `execute_query`, `mod.rs` applies `apply_temporal_enrichment` (per-file DB lookups) if temporal sort flags are present.

### AST Flag Helpers — `ast.rs`

Four responsibilities:

- `open_ast_engine(cache_dir)` — fails loud (Err) when `ast_index.skidx` is absent; gives build guidance in error message.
- `validate_ast_pattern(raw)` — called at dispatch time BEFORE opening the index. Rejects `SingleNode` queries (`#283`) and unknown patterns.
- `resolve_ast_file_filter(engine, raw)` — **calls `search_ast` directly** (not through `SearchLayer`). Parses the pattern, calls `engine.search_ast(&query)`, returns `HashSet<FileId>` from the `Vec<(FileId, f64)>` result. No `SearchResult` construction, no `usize::MAX` sort, no `SearchLayer` overhead. The caller's `--limit` applies at intersection time inside the lexical engine.
- `run_ast_standalone` — standalone `--ast` dispatch (no text query, no temporal flags). Also calls `search_ast` directly, applies `limit` via `.take(limit)` after the raw search, then warns on out-of-range FileIds rather than silently dropping them.

**`resolve_ast_file_filter` signature** (no `lang` parameter): the function no longer accepts a `lang: Option<Language>` parameter. Language filtering at the AST layer was removed — the intersection with lexical results handles language narrowing implicitly.

**FileId warning in `run_ast_standalone`**: when `fid.0 as usize >= sorted.len()`, a warning is emitted to stderr: `"skim search [warn]: AST result FileId({idx}) is out of manifest range ..."`. This follows the ADR-006 counterpart on the read side (fail-loud-ish on desync, not silent drop).

**Output-level only — no `:line` suffix**: standalone AST output is file-level. Results are formatted as `path  score: N.NNN` with no line number suffix.

### Temporal Flag Helpers — `temporal.rs`

Mirrors `ast.rs` in structure. Two independent data flows:

- **Blast-radius**: resolves a user path to co-change partners via `normalize_blast_radius_path` → `db.cochanges_for_file`. Returns `HashSet<String>` of repo-relative paths (including the target file itself). Converted to FileIds in `query.rs`.
- **Sort/annotation**: `apply_temporal_enrichment` annotates `Vec<ResolvedResult>` with hotspot/risk scores (per-file DB lookups) and re-sorts. O(N) DB queries — acceptable at default `--limit 20`, noted for large limits.

`check_temporal_staleness` (in `temporal.rs`) uses `git rev-parse HEAD` via subprocess with a 5-second timeout — distinct from the pure-file-I/O staleness check in `staleness.rs`. The subprocess path is used only for the temporal DB stale check, not for rebuilding.

### Manifest Sidecar — `manifest.rs`

JSONL file at `{cache_dir}/index.skfiles`. First line is a `ManifestHeader` (version, root path, optional `git_head`). Subsequent lines are `ManifestEntry` records (path, sha256, lang, field_map triples, mtime).

The manifest serves three purposes:
1. SHA-256 cache for incremental builds (avoids re-classifying unchanged files)
2. FileId → path mapping for query resolution (via `sorted_paths()`)
3. git HEAD storage for staleness detection

Writes are atomic (temp file + rename). Wrong-root detection: if the stored root path in the header doesn't match the current project root, the entire manifest is discarded.

## Constraints

**Concurrent build safety**: all callers that write index files (direct `--build`/`--rebuild`, git hook `--update`, `auto_refresh_if_stale`) acquire `.skim-build.lock` before touching index files. Never write to `index.skidx` or `ast_index.skidx` without holding this lock.

**FileId contract**: FileId is a 0-based integer assigned to files in the order they appear in `manifest.sorted_paths()`. It must be stable across the entire build cycle — the lexical and AST indexes must agree. Never break the consumer loop's `continue`-on-lexical-error + always-insert-AST-entry pattern.

**Graceful degradation**: missing `temporal.db` → warning + exit 0 (not error). Missing AST index → loud error (the user explicitly asked for `--ast`). Stale temporal data → warning on stderr, query proceeds.

**Commit ordering**: manifest is always the last thing written. If any index build fails, `manifest.save()` must not be called. The presence of the manifest is the "both indexes are coherent" signal.

**Validation order in `run()`**: the exact order (legacy subcommand, help, `--ast`+temporal, single-node, unknown pattern) is tested and must not change without updating the tests in `mod.rs`.

**`auto_refresh_if_stale` before any index open**: both `run_ast_standalone` and `run_query` (the combined text+`--ast` path) must call `auto_refresh_if_stale` BEFORE opening the AST engine. Opening the engine first breaks self-heal for the combined path.

## Anti-Patterns

**Adding I/O to `ast.rs` or `temporal.rs` beyond what they already have.** These are focused helper modules. New queries, formatters, or DB operations belong there, but filesystem operations (cache dir resolution, lock acquisition) belong in `mod.rs` or `index.rs`.

**Calling `manifest.save()` after a failed index build.** Any code path that calls `builder.build()` or `ast_builder.build()` and then calls `manifest.save()` regardless of success breaks the crash-safety invariant. The manifest must only be saved when ALL index writes succeed.

**Adding temporal sort + `--ast` compound queries without resolving #202.** The current code explicitly errors on this combination. Do not silently degrade or ignore one of the flags — either implement the intersection (with a tracking ticket) or keep the error.

**Constructing FileIds from `idx as u32` (applies PF-004).** The file cap (50,000) makes overflow impossible in practice, but use `u32::try_from(idx)` everywhere FileId values are constructed from positional indexes. This is already the pattern in `query.rs` and must be followed consistently.

**Breaking the `index.rs` consume loop's fail-soft / fail-loud contract.** Lexical errors (from `add_file_classified`) are fail-soft: `continue` and skip the file from both indexes. AST errors (from `add_file_ngrams`) after a successful lexical insert are fail-loud: `return Err(...)` to abort the build. Do not swap these — fail-soft AST errors after a lexical success would advance `next_file_id` and corrupt the index.

**Routing CLI AST queries through `SearchLayer::search` instead of `search_ast`.** `resolve_ast_file_filter` and `run_ast_standalone` call `engine.search_ast(&query)` directly. Using `SearchLayer::search` adds overhead (SearchResult construction, usize::MAX sort) and the `lang` filter is not needed for the intersection/standalone paths.

**Calling `open_ast_engine` before `auto_refresh_if_stale` in the combined text+`--ast` path.** This was the root cause of regression #10. The fix: in `run_query`, call `auto_refresh_if_stale` before any index open, same as `run_ast_standalone`.

**Silently dropping out-of-range FileIds in AST result resolution.** `run_ast_standalone` warns on stderr when a FileId is beyond the manifest range. Do not revert to silent `filter_map` — out-of-range FileIds indicate index desync and the user needs to know.

## Gotchas

**`skim search index` vs `skim search --build`**: the `"index"` prefix check in `run()` is a legacy subcommand path. It dispatches to `index.rs::run()` which uses clap for its own flag parsing. The parent `run()` does not call `parse_flags()` for this path. `--help` for `skim search index` goes to the clap-generated help, not `print_help()`.

**Help is checked before `parse_flags`**: `--help` / `-h` in the top-level handler is caught BEFORE calling `parse_flags`. If help appears anywhere in `args` alongside a subcommand, `print_help()` is called. This is a regression risk — a test covers `skim search index --help` dispatching to index help not parent help.

**Blast-radius includes the target file itself**: `resolve_blast_radius_filter` adds the normalized path for the target file to the `HashSet` of partners. This is intentional — text queries like `skim search auth --blast-radius src/auth.rs` should surface matches within `src/auth.rs` itself, not just its co-change partners.

**`sorted_paths()` order = FileId**: the manifest stores entries in a `BTreeMap<String, ManifestEntry>` keyed by path. `sorted_paths()` returns keys in sorted order. The NgramIndexBuilder assigns FileId 0 to the first file sent to `add_file_classified`, 1 to the second, and so on — matching the consumer loop's `next_file_id` counter. These must stay in sync. If the manifest's sorted order ever differs from the build order, FileId → path resolution will silently mis-map results.

**AST self-heal and `NoStoredHead`**: `check_staleness` returns `NoStoredHead` (not a dedicated `AstStale` variant) when the AST index needs rebuilding. This means callers that pattern-match on `NoStoredHead` to detect "no git HEAD" will also be triggered by an AST-stale condition. Do not rely on `NoStoredHead` meaning exclusively "no git HEAD".

**`temporal.rs::read_git_head` is subprocess-based**: unlike `staleness.rs::read_git_head` (pure file I/O), the temporal staleness check in `temporal.rs` spawns `git rev-parse HEAD` with a 5-second timeout. These are two separate implementations for different callers. Do not unify them without understanding the divergent requirements (the staleness.rs version must work without any subprocess for speed; the temporal.rs version needs robustness in edge cases where packed-refs format may differ).

**`#289` temporal rebuild hook point**: `auto_refresh_if_stale` has a `TODO(#289)` comment immediately after the manifest load. When the temporal populate path is implemented, the call should go here (under the same `.skim-build.lock`, reusing the already-read HEAD).

**`--stats HEAD` field**: the `run_stats` handler reads the git HEAD from the manifest (not from the git repo), so it reflects the HEAD at the time of the last build, not the current HEAD. This is intentional — it shows the state the index was built from.

**`derive_ast_entry` is infallible by design**: any error in linearization or extraction returns an empty triple. The consume loop then inserts an empty AST entry for that FileId. This is correct — the FileId alignment invariant requires every lexically-accepted file to also have an AST entry. The only fail-loud path is when `add_file_ngrams` itself rejects the entry after a lexical success, which indicates a library-level invariant violation.

## Test Coverage Summary (ast_tests.rs)

The test file is organized in ten groups:
- **Groups 1–5**: unit tests for `validate_ast_pattern`, `parse_flags` AST variants
- **Group 6**: disjoint intersection (empty text + `--ast` returns empty, exit 0)
- **Group 7**: `run_ast_standalone` with real index — FileId→path mapping, absent-index loud-fail
- **Group 8**: text+`--ast` intersection against real index — preserves lexical snippets
- **Group 9**: self-heal for below-FORMAT_VERSION probe (v1 stub → stale)
- **Group 10**: regression — combined text+`--ast` path self-heals when AST index is absent

Group 6 test was tightened from graceful-skip-on-build-error to `.expect("--build must succeed")`.
