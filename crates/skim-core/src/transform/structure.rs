/// # What to Keep
///
/// - Function/method signatures
/// - Class declarations
/// - Type definitions
/// - Imports/exports
/// - Structural comments (if config.preserve_comments)
///
/// # What to Remove
///
/// - Function bodies â†’ `/* ... */`
/// - Implementation details
/// - Non-structural comments
///
/// # Implementation Notes (Week 2)
///
/// 1. Traverse AST with TreeCursor
/// 2. For each function/method node:
///    - Extract signature (everything before `{`)
///    - Replace body with `/* ... */`
/// 3. For classes: keep structure, strip method bodies
/// 4. Preserve indentation
